README file Musculoskeletal Modelling and Simulation. 
By Rudi Smits and Melissa Molenaars

The following files are included:
DynamicJumperModel.osim
DynamicJumperModelV2.osim
OptimalJump_DefaultControls.xml
OptimalJump_DefaultControlsV2.xml

Here, the DynamicJumperModel.osim and the OptimalJump_DefaultControls.xml
file are the benchmark / unedited model of the optimal jumper model. 
The *V3.osim and *V3.xml files are the modified jumper models. 

The model is run throug OpenSim (version 4.1). 

In the GUI, first the V3.osim model must be opened. Then the 
control file (*V3.xml) is added through the forward motion tool.
